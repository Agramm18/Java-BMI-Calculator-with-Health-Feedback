# BMI Calculator

## Project Overview

The **BMI Calculator** is a simple Java program designed to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input. It provides feedback on the result by categorizing the BMI into different health classifications. This project was created as part of learning Java and demonstrates basic programming concepts like user input, mathematical calculations, and conditional statements.

## Features

1. **User Input**  
   - The program asks the user to enter their height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms).
   - It confirms the input by rounding the values to two decimal places for better accuracy.

2. **BMI Calculation**  
   - The program uses the standard formula for BMI:  
     \[
     BMI = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2}
     \]

3. **Health Feedback**  
   - Based on the calculated BMI, the program provides a health category, such as:
     - Underweight
     - Normal weight
     - Overweight
     - Obesity (Class 1, 2, or 3)

4. **Rounded Outputs**  
   - To make the results easier to understand, all calculations are rounded to two decimal places.

## Why This Project?

This project is a beginner-friendly demonstration of essential Java programming skills:
- **User Input Handling**: Reading input from the user using `Scanner`.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Performing calculations with precision.
- **Conditional Logic**: Using `if-else` statements to classify results.
- **Basic Code Organization**: Writing clear and readable code with comments.

## How to Run

1. **Requirements**:  
   - Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer.  
   - Use a code editor or IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or a simple text editor.

2. **Steps**:  
   - Copy the code into a file named `BmiCalculator.java`.  
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and compile the program:
     ```bash
     javac BmiCalculator.java
     ```
   - Run the program:
     ```bash
     java BmiCalculator
     ```

3. **Usage**:  
   - Follow the instructions to input your height and weight.  
   - The program will calculate your BMI and display a health classification.

## Notes

This project was created as part of my early Java learning journey. It is a simple example of how Java can be used to create a basic but functional application. In the future, I plan to improve the program by adding input validation, error handling, and perhaps a graphical interface. For now, it serves as a demonstration of my progress in learning programming.
